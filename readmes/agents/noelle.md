# Noelle — Load Balancer

**One-liner:** I coordinate exclusive zones, preposition vehicles for anticipated demand, and manage storage — but I have no central process; I am a distributed behavior that emerges from Nora instances.
**Ouch-list items I own:** M-06 (switch failure with pod in transit), NEW-05 (no governance for network-wide policy changes)
**Signing status:** Not yet — Noelle has no central process and thus no key pair yet

---

## podPresenter — Noelle's Fleet Visibility Layer

Noelle's fleet-level awareness lives partly in podPresenter. Two aspects:

**1. Ezone coordination** — Noelle's distributed behavior is visible in podPresenter via the ezone stack display (ezoneStack in MQTT.pde). Noelle has no central process; podPresenter visualizes the emergent coordination in real time.

**2. Matilda.pde** — Fleet calibration panel embedded in podPresenter. Matilda receives `CALIBRATION` messages from all Nora instances, tracks per-pod mmStep history, detects wheel wear and collective map errors, writes `json/fleet_log.json`. Matilda is Noelle's instrument for watching the physical health of the fleet.

Allie pushes `podIP.json` (via `update_pod_ips.sh`) before launching podPresenter. This tells Natalie/Noelle which pods are on the network. Noelle's fleet-level view requires that Allie has done the MAC-based discovery first.

## Responsibilities

- Exclusive zone (ezone) coordination — only one pod in a merge zone at a time
- Speed adaptation at ezones — zipper merge, not stop-and-wait
- Storage management — move idle pods to storage rails, recall when needed (not yet implemented)
- Prepositioning — dispatch pods to anticipated demand before requests arrive (not yet implemented)
- Network-wide parameter distribution (speed limits, weight limits, headway) — governance mechanism not yet designed (NEW-05)

---

## Design Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Pre-2026 | Noelle is a distributed behavior — each Nora runs ezone.py; emergent coordination IS Noelle | This is the patent's core innovation: no central controller; adding a central Noelle process would contradict the design |
| 2026-04-04 | Zipper merge replaces stop-and-wait at ezones | Stop-and-stop creates throughput bottleneck at every merge point; speed adjustment keeps traffic moving |
| 2026-04-04 | ezForeignPods table tracks converging pods' entry distance for speed calculation | Each Nora independently computes her approach timing; no central coordination needed |
| 2026-05-31 | Noelle refuses any template whose lines.json lacks both `eps_header` and `eps[]` | eps[] is the topological contract authored and approved by the model designer. Without `eps_header`, the contract has not been approved — Noelle cannot safely route through an unverified topology. Fault message directs the model designer to author eps[] and run Lines JSON Build from eps. |
| 2026-05-31 | map.json and path.json are built per-network at BUILD time, not pre-built at template level | World coordinates depend on instance placement. Inter-station segments (seg_*) are inherently network topology. lines.json (local coords + topology) IS the template-level pre-build. BUILD reads it and applies world transform. Adding a template-level map.json would duplicate lines.json at a different coordinate level — work done twice, new format to maintain. |
| 2026-06-06 | Segment IDs are permanent — assigned once in `{model}.segment_registry.json`, never reused | map.json schema v4 adds `id` field to every line entry. Once a segment is built and assigned an ID, that ID is permanent across all future rebuilds. Retired segments (deleted/renamed) get `retired_at` timestamp — their ID is never reassigned. This allows history tracking, telemetry correlation, and maintenance records to key on a stable integer. Sequential-on-every-Build IDs broke all prior correlation. |
| 2026-06-06 | Proof Lines scopes to active template formation; never crosses CP boundaries | `populate_from_open_template` sets `@active_template_formation`; `proof_lines` filters to that formation only. When the template model is active OR Extract Template was run in the current session, Proof shows only that template. Station label is `{formation} (to_be_assigned)` — no network S-ID until placed. Running Proof from the full network model (with no active template set) shows all stations. |

---

## Division of Authority — Template Topology

This is the constitutional boundary between model designer and Noelle:

| Role | Authority | File |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Model designer** | Authors eps[] (topology contract) and signs with eps_header | `lines.json` |
| **build_from_eps tool** | Reads eps[], scans geometry, fills start_point/end_point — preserves eps_header | `lines.json` |
| **run_from_template tool** | Derives eps from geometry — BLOCKED when eps_header exists | — |
| **Noelle** | Reads lines.json for routing; may report defects; may NOT change eps[] | reads only |
| **BUILD** | Reads lines.json + formation maps, applies world transform, writes network files | `map.json`, `path.json` |

**eps_header schema:**
```json
"eps_header": {
  "approved_by": "Name",
  "dt": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "note": "Source file or authoring context. Noelle may report defects but may not change eps[]."
}
```

**Why this division matters:** eps[] is a physical claim about how the station connects internally. It cannot be derived from geometry alone without human judgment about what is intentional vs. error. The model designer is the only party who can make that judgment. Noelle can observe that a junction is a model_error, but she cannot decide whether to fix it or whether it is actually correct.

---

## Noelle's Two Modes — Model and Network

Noelle operates in exactly two modes. She never mixes them. Debugging done in
model_mode produces no artifacts visible to network_mode, and vice versa.

---

### model_mode — Template Authoring

**When:** The designer opens a template `model.skp` directly in SketchUp.

**What Noelle does:**
- Scans live SketchUp geometry for gw_* tagged entities
- Extracts CP positions from cp_marker_* components → writes `cp.json`
- Extracts track geometry (pts_mm, tangents, arc radii) → writes `extracted.json`
- Validates arc diameters, vector_in edges, connectivity within the template

**What Noelle reads:** live SketchUp model geometry (no network files needed)

**What Noelle writes:**
- `templates/track_formations/{formation}/cp.json` — CP positions in template-local coordinates
- `templates/track_formations/{formation}/extracted.json` — track geometry in template-local coordinates

**Entry point:** `Models › Extract Template` (console step 3)

**The contract:** When model_mode finishes cleanly, the template is ready for network deployment. cp.json and extracted.json are the handoff artifacts. They are never written by network_mode.

---

### network_mode — Network Operations

**When:** A network model (with placed station instances) is the active model.

**What Noelle does:**
- Reads `lines.json` (designer-authored topology) for routing declarations
- Reads `extracted.json` (Noelle-authored geometry) for track pts_mm
- Reads `cp.json` (Noelle-authored) for CP world positions after transform
- Builds `map.json` + `path.json` at Build time (world coordinates)
- Runs `Network Geometry` check to verify all placed stations have complete extracted.json
- Validates, routes, animates

**What Noelle reads:** `lines.json`, `extracted.json`, `cp.json`, SketchUp inter-station beam_path attributes

**What Noelle writes:** `map.json`, `path.json` (network-scope, world coordinates, rebuilt on every Build)

**What Noelle never writes in network_mode:** `cp.json`, `extracted.json` — those belong to model_mode

**Entry points:**
- `Models › Network Geometry` (step 4) — read-only validation
- `Models › Build` — generates map.json + path.json

**If extracted.json is missing:** BUILD fails immediately with a loud error naming the template. The fix is always: open the template model and run Extract Template. Network_mode never extracts geometry from a placed instance as a fallback.

---

### Data Ownership Summary

| File | Authored by | Read by | Never written by |
|------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| `lines.json` | Model designer | Noelle network_mode | Noelle (either mode) |
| `cp.json` | Noelle model_mode | Noelle network_mode | Noelle network_mode |
| `extracted.json` | Noelle model_mode | Noelle network_mode | Noelle network_mode |
| `map.json` | Noelle network_mode | Natalie, Nora, Alice | Noelle model_mode |
| `path.json` | Noelle network_mode | Nora animator | Noelle model_mode |
| `{model}.segment_registry.json` | Noelle network_mode (Build) | Noelle network_mode | model_mode |

**lines.json contains only topology — never coordinates.**
pts_mm, startPoint, endPoint, length_mm, segments are extracted.json fields.
If coordinates appear in lines.json, they are legacy contamination — remove them.

## Noelle as Slime Mold — Sensor-Driven Network Optimization

Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) finds optimal paths through a network by
sending exploratory tendrils toward food sources, reinforcing paths that reach
food, and letting paths that do not reach food atrophy. The result is a minimum-
cost network that adapts continuously to where food is.

**Noelle is the slime mold of the JPods network.**
She does not plan routes (that is Natalie). She evaluates the network itself —
where demand is, where capacity is underused, where sensors are needed to see
what she cannot currently see — and recommends network topology changes.

### What Noelle hunts (food sources = demand)

| Signal | What it reveals | Sensor required |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Passenger trip density by segment | Which connections carry the most load | Trip log (already available) |
| Dead-head trip frequency by station | Which stations are poorly located or undersized | Trip log + mission field |
| Cargo volume by station | Which stations serve logistics demand | Cargo mission trips |
| Waste volume by station | Which stations serve residential density | Waste mission trips |
| Cellphone density at pedestrian speeds | Latent demand not yet served by any station | Carrier aggregate data feed |
| Bike/pedestrian counts at guideway cameras | Last-Mile mode activity; weather/price calibration | Cameras on guideway structure |
| Time-of-day demand curves | When and where demand peaks | Trip log aggregated by hour |
| Weather factor (1–5) | How mode shift responds to conditions | Weather API |
| Price factor (1–5) | Whether pricing is at equilibrium | Trip log + camera counts |

### What Noelle concludes (path reinforcement)

- **High passenger density on a segment** → recommend adding a station midpoint
  or a parallel connection to increase capacity
- **High dead-head frequency at a station** → station is in the wrong place or
  too small; recommend relocating or adding platforms
- **Cargo/waste volume concentrated at specific stations** → logistics hub
  opportunity; recommend dedicated cargo platform
- **Camera shows high bike activity near a station** → Last-Mile is healthy;
  station placement is correct
- **Camera shows low bike activity despite good weather** → Last-Mile gap;
  recommend bike infrastructure investment near that station
- **Segment unused for >N hours** → candidate for atrophy; flag to Bill for
  consideration of rerouting or decommissioning

### What Noelle cannot yet see (sensor gaps)

- Physical cargo weights per pod (requires onboard scale or weight sensor)
- Actual passenger count per pod (requires seat sensors or app check-in)
- Waste category composition at station (requires sorting sensors)
- Intersection-level pedestrian counts (requires street-level cameras, not just guideway)

These sensor gaps are Noelle's open questions — she knows what she would learn
if she could see them, and she flags them as investment priorities as the network
grows.

**The slime mold principle applied:**
Noelle does not need a master plan. She reinforces what works and flags what does
not. The network topology that emerges from her sensor-driven recommendations over
time is the optimal network for actual demand — not the network a planner predicted.

---

## Noelle's Role in the Routing Intelligence Stack

Noelle is the capacity layer in Natalie's three-layer routing decision. She does not route and she does not price. She provides one thing: **time-projected segment load**.

```
Natalie queries Noelle at dispatch time:
  "Segment X — what is projected occupancy in T+2 minutes?"

Noelle answers from her load map:
  "Currently 2 pods, 3 more en route, arrives full at T+1:45"

Natalie weights X accordingly.
```

**Why time-projected, not current:** A segment clear *now* but with 3 pods already routed to it is a worse choice than a segment with 1 pod that has low demand. Current occupancy is a lagging indicator. Noelle's projection accounts for pods already en route — it is the leading indicator.

**How Noelle builds the projection:**
- All pods on the network report their current segment and speed (TELEMETRY)
- Noelle knows each pod's remaining travel time on its current segment
- Projected occupancy = current count + inbound pods arriving before T+window
- Window = configurable headway buffer (start with 2× pod headway)

**What Noelle does NOT do:** price incentives (Alice owns that), route selection (Natalie owns that), or demand forecasting beyond the current trip pool. Noelle sees pods, not passengers.

**Current state:** Not yet implemented. `@@anim_state` in the SketchUp animator tracks live positions but does not project forward. Route-Time's congestion weights are a static ratio, not a time-projected load. The segment-load API Natalie needs is the first implementation step.

**Connection to slime mold:** Noelle's real-time load map is the short-term version of her long-term topology recommendations. Both are the same mechanism at different time scales: reinforce what flows, flag what stalls.

---

## Open Questions

- Network-wide parameter changes (speed limits, weight limits, headway): how does a distributed system adopt a new parameter simultaneously? No governance mechanism exists (NEW-05 — "Articles of Confederation flaw")
- Storage dispatch: when does a pod go to storage? Who decides? How does she know where storage is?
- Prepositioning: what demand signal does Noelle use? Historical patterns? Real-time requests?
- Switch control: Noelle is supposed to control physical switches (patent claim 3) — this is not implemented; switches are currently manual or not present in scale model
- If two Noelle instances on separate networks need to merge at a hub, what is the coordination protocol?

---

## Interfaces

**Sends (MQTT — distributed, from each Nora):**
- Ezone state embedded in TELEMETRY (`ezoneId`, `ezState`)

**Receives (MQTT):**
- TELEMETRY from all pods — ezone state used to build ezoneStack

**Signs:** N/A — distributed behavior, no central process

**Requires signatures from:** N/A — same

## Design Decisions — SketchUp Plugin (jpods-plugin context only)

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-27 | `component_definition_faults()` fail-fast gate added | A lost week was caused by stations not properly defined (no Sxxx ID, no platform tag) — silent degradation was worse than a loud failure |
| 2026-04-27 | Stations missing `platform_guideways` are flagged immediately | Natalie cannot route to a platform that Noelle cannot find; better to fail at definition time than at route time |
| 2026-05-09 | `define_network` 5-phase hard gate added to `noelle.rb` | Schema, model dict, connection structure refs, successor/predecessor graph, and platform line_id must all pass before Natalie may plan any trip |
| 2026-05-09 | `normalize_network` re-sequences all line_ids in canonical order after gate passes | Canonical IDs make followme.json deterministic across rebuilds; logs any renumbering so operator can verify trip files are still valid |
| 2026-05-09 | `review_recommendations` auto-runs after every followme.json export | Noelle speaks without being asked — flags isolated tracks, missing CPs, u_turn ambiguity, no-guideway connections, via_markers gaps, and connectivity between stations |
| 2026-05-09 | 1-CP station check added to `component_definition_faults` | S010 had 1 CP — could be a terminus or a missing stub_pair tag; Noelle now demands the operator confirm intent by adding `travel_routes: ['u_turn']` if it is a terminus |
| 2026-05-09 | `review_recommendations` via_markers audit falls back to connections dict if `network_definition` absent | Defensive — some older v2 exports may lack the authoring block; Noelle still audits what she can |
| 2026-05-10 | `purge_stale_trip_files` runs after every followme export | No legacy support — stale trip files (missing or mismatched `followme_generated_at`) are deleted and operator is alerted immediately. Trip files must be rebuilt. |
| 2026-05-10 | Internal connection naming: `"#{sid}_#{conn_name}"` replaces `"#{sid}_internal_N"` | Ordinal naming breaks when station templates gain new internal routes; connection_id-based naming is stable. |
| 2026-05-10 | Direction strings: `"out"` / `"in"` / `"u_turn"` replace unicode arrow strings | Arrow strings were ambiguous about which structure is the reference. `out` = forward (index 1), `in` = return (index 0). |
| 2026-04-27 | `STOP_REVIEW_THRESHOLD = 3` — streak counter escalates after 3 consecutive validation fault runs | Repeated validation failures without escalation let bad state persist invisibly; 3-strike rule forces explicit operator review |
| 2026-04-27 | `definition_hunt_instruction()` returns canonical corrective message | Consistent language across all agents so operators always know what action to take |
| 2026-04-30 | Platform siding guideway instance name should include `track` (preferred `Track-platform`) | FollowMe structure export is more resilient when the real berth guideway still identifies itself as a track in Entity Info; the `platform` tag marks role, `track` marks geometry source |

---

## Notes to Other Agents

- **Nora:** You are already running me. ezone.py and the zipper merge code in collision.py are Noelle's behaviors. When you report ezoneId and ezState in TELEMETRY, you are publishing Noelle's state.
- **Natalie:** When networks grow, you and I may need a coordination interface. Currently we do not communicate directly — you set routes, I coordinate ezones locally. That may not scale.
- **Athena:** NEW-05 is yours to help design — a distributed system needs a ratification-equivalent for policy changes. The Articles of Confederation precedent is the right frame.
- **Allie:** You provide the network map (podIP.json via update_pod_ips.sh) before Natalie launches. My fleet view only makes sense once I know who is on the network. That handoff is yours.

---

## How Allie Reads Noelle's State

Noelle has no central process and no dedicated MQTT topic. Her state is embedded in every TELEMETRY message on the SERVER topic.

**To check if a pod is ezone-blocked:**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.189 -t SERVER -v | grep TELEMETRY
```
TELEMETRY field layout (0-indexed, comma-split):
```
TELEMETRY, podName, line, mmDist, speed, servo,
podFront, podBack, ezoneId, ezState, pathId,
pwrL, pwrR, encL, encR, spdLAvg, spdRAvg,
distL, distR, battVolt, mmDistTotal, encTotalL, encTotalR
  [0]         [1]    [2]   [3]    [4]    [5]
  [6]           [7]        [8]       [9]    [10]
```
- **`ezoneId` (field 8):** 0 = not near an ezone; non-zero = approaching or in ezone N
- **`ezState` (field 9):** 0 = clear; 1 = registered in ezone stack; 2 = inside ezone
- **`blockedByEZ`** in config.py — set True only when `planZipperApproach()` finds no reachable gap in the ezone

**If a pod is stuck with `ezState != 0` and won't move:**
1. Check if another pod is also in the ezone stack (two pods collided at entry point)
2. Send `ACTION,RESET,POD_X,` — this clears the pod's ezone state and stops the motor
3. After reset, send `ACTION,RUN,POD_X,1,` to restart

**Normal operation:** `blockedByEZ` should almost never be True with zipper merge active. If it is, it means every reachable speed puts the pod in conflict — usually because two pods are too close at the ezone entry. A RESET on the slower pod resolves it.

---

## Physical Observation Layer — `{model}.physical.json`

**Why it is separate from feature.json:**
`feature.json` is regenerated by Noelle on every Build and Validate — it is a
routing declaration, not a log. Physical observations accumulate over time and must
survive rebuilds. They live in a separate file: `{model}.physical.json`.

**Who writes it:** Nora writes per-line observations during and after each trip.
Field team may add entries manually. Noelle reads it and flags routes where
observations exceed severity threshold.

**Schema: `jpods-physical-v1`**

```json
{
  "schema": "jpods-physical-v1",
  "model_id": "CA_Gilroy_Clean",
  "note": "Per-line physical observations. Accumulated by Nora over trips. Not overwritten by Build or Validate.",
  "lines": {
    "seg_S048_cp1_S050_cp0": {
      "observations": [
        {
          "type": "bump",
          "location_t": 0.34,
          "severity": "minor",
          "description": "column joint at ~34% of segment",
          "logged_at": "2026-05-17T14:32:00Z",
          "logged_by": "NORA_0001"
        }
      ]
    },
    "S048.gw_uturn_1": {
      "observations": [
        {
          "type": "alignment_issue",
          "location_t": 0.5,
          "severity": "moderate",
          "description": "pod yaws right at apex — track seam visible",
          "logged_at": "2026-05-17T14:33:00Z",
          "logged_by": "NORA_0001"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Line IDs in physical.json match trip.json exactly:**
- Inter-station: `seg_S048_cp1_S050_cp0` (from `network_definition.connections`)
- Intra-station: `S048.gw_uturn_1`, `S048.gw_far_main`, etc. (sid.tag from feature.json)

`trip.json` provides the canonical list of all segment IDs for any O-D pair.
Iterating over `trip['segments']` gives the complete set of lines that need
physical observation records for that route.

**Observation types:**

| Type | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| `bump` | Nora IMU / encoder spike | Column joint, expansion gap, debris |
| `obstruction` | Nora TOF / HuskyLens | Low branch, signage encroachment |
| `speed_anomaly` | Nora encoder vs expected | Grade steeper than modeled, drag |
| `alignment_issue` | Nora yaw sensor | Track seam causing pod to yaw |
| `vibration` | Nora IMU | Resonance frequency at a specific segment |
| `debris` | Nora or field team | Leaves, ice, standing water |
| `weather` | Field team | Wind exposure, solar glare, ice formation |
| `other` | Any source | Free-text description |

**`location_t`** — parametric position along the segment: 0.0 = start end,
1.0 = far end. Allows pinpointing the physical location for maintenance.

**Severity scale:**

| Severity | Meaning | Noelle response |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `minor` | Pod completes trip; degraded comfort or efficiency | Log; report at next review |
| `moderate` | Pod completes trip; requires attention before next run | Flag route; notify operator |
| `severe` | Pod may not complete trip safely | Block route; require operator sign-off to re-enable |

**Noelle's use of physical.json:**
Before confirming a route is clear, Noelle scans physical.json for the segments in
that trip. Any `severe` observation blocks the route. Any `moderate` observation
generates a warning. `minor` observations are aggregated and reported at review
intervals. This is how the physical network self-documents: every bump Nora feels
becomes a maintenance record Noelle can act on.

**Not yet implemented:** Physical.json writing is designed but not yet coded in
`main.py`. Nora currently writes `nora.json` trip summaries with `anomalies: []`
reserved. The first implementation step is populating `anomalies` from IMU/encoder
spikes and writing them to physical.json in the segment format above.

---

## Three Domains at a Glance

| Domain | What Noelle IS here | Key file / tool |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **SketchUp** | Definition validator — checks station/CP definitions before Natalie routes | `noelle.rb` in jpods-plugin |
| **Route-Time** | Network graph manager — holds line weights, enforces jam threshold, signals Natalie on congestion | `engine/network.py` |
| **Scale Model / 4WD** | Distributed ezone coordinator — emerges from each Nora's `ezone.py`; no central process | `ezone.py` on each Pi |
| **SkyRide** | Same distributed ezone role; elevated guideway changes approach physics | TBD — not yet documented |
| **JPods Full System** | Ezone + storage dispatch + prepositioning + switch control (patent claim 3) | TBD — not yet implemented |

**Critical distinction:** In SketchUp, Noelle validates *design*. In Route-Time, she enforces *simulation physics*. In physical, she coordinates *real-time exclusion zones*. Same role (capacity), three completely different mechanisms.

---

## Retrospection Against Memory Markers — Noelle's Measurement Obligation

Noelle validates per build. Her markers are: validation fault patterns, Universal Rules
below, Understanding entries (U-SK-*, U-RT-*, U-PH-*), and the gap log. Per build:
did faults recur that a prior Understanding said were resolved? Did a rule flagged as
universal actually hold, or did it break in a new domain? Grade A–F. Repeated faults
after a documented fix = the fix didn't work or the designer didn't absorb the lesson.
Escalate — don't silently re-log the same fault.

---

## Universal Rules

These hold across all three domains. A rule that appears violated is an implementation error, not a lesson.

| Rule | Why universal |
|------|--------------|
| CCW ring flow | JPods physics, not software choice |
| One-way guideways — Red = inbound, Blue = outbound | Physical track is one-way; simulation and design must match |
| Capacity limits are real — congestion is a signal, not an error | Physical queueing, simulation queueing, and design reviews all surface this |
| No half-connections — CPs connect to CPs, both lines or neither | Boundary abstraction holds in all three tools |
| **Edge-driven specs, sensors, and metrics — no calculated centerlines** | All position references, ezone boundaries, clearance specs, and sensor targets are defined on hard physical edges (beam bottom face, platform edge, stub end edge). Never on a computed midpoint or centerline. SketchUp proved this definitively: FollowMe walks edges natively; attempts to feed it a derived centerline caused animation failures. Sensors must also reference edges — a TOF reads distance to an edge; an AprilTag is mounted on an edge surface. If a centerline is needed for display, derive it from two known edges — never store it as the authoritative reference. |
| **Noelle reads structure identity from placed instances — never writes it** | `structure_type` is declared by the model author inside every template `model.skp`. Noelle reads it; she does not create or backfill it. She reads from four sources in priority order: (1) JPods attribute on the placed instance (written by StructurePlacer), (2) entity tag (layer name) on the placed instance, (3) instance name, (4) definition name prefix. A missing type after all four checks = placement fault. The model author is responsible for setting the tag and naming correctly. |
| **On/off behaviors live in one function with a parameter — never paired do_x/undo_x** | A behavior that can be turned on or off is encoded as `f(model, enabled:)` or `f(model, install:)`. The caller declares intent; the function owns how to achieve it. Two separate functions split ownership, force callers to know implementation details, and drift apart when one is updated and the other isn't. Violations: any paired `restore_x`/`remove_x`, `enable_x`/`disable_x`, `add_x`/`delete_x` that share the same domain. **Policed by Athena (code review), Allie (pattern detection), Alice (API surface review).** Established 2026-05-23. |
| **Approach curves are mandatory before every station CP and merge point — inter-station guideways only** | In the last APPROACH_CHECK_DEPTH metres before each station CP or ezone merge point, every inter-station guideway must maintain a curve radius ≥ MIN_APPROACH_CURVE_RADIUS (currently 8 m). This is a momentum rule, not an aesthetic one. Approach curve radius sets the floor on the speed at which Nora arrives at a junction. That arrival speed is the input to the zipper merge gap calculation: `personal_space ≥ (speed × reaction_time) + braking_distance`. A sharp curve forces a speed reduction the zipper algorithm did not plan for, producing an incorrect gap estimate and potential collision risk. **Enforcement boundary:** curves below MIN_APPROACH_CURVE_RADIUS are required inside features — U-turns, traffic circles, platform loops. These tight curves are built into the feature geometry, executed at reduced station-entry speed under the feature's own ezone speed limit, and never at cruise speed. `check_approach_curves()` explicitly skips internal-connection and platform-host guideways. **Responsibility:** it is the network designer's responsibility to accommodate the geometric requirements of features in the surrounding layout — providing sufficient approach distance, orienting stations to face their connections, and placing waypoint markers to guide gentle curves. Noelle flags violations; she does not move stations. Cross-domain: same rule governs ezone entry speed (physical), segment throughput weighting (Route-Time), and CP placement (SketchUp). |

## Cross-Domain Mappings

| Concept | SketchUp | Route-Time | Physical |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Capacity signal | Missing `platform_guideways` tag | `line_stats.congestion > 0.7` | `ezoneId` congestion at merge zones |
| Jam / failure | `component_definition_faults()` fault list | `congestion = 1.0` → infinite weight | `blockedByEZ = True` |
| Recovery | Fix definition; rerun validation | Add guideway; Natalie reroutes | RESET slower pod; restart |
| Stop-and-review trigger | 3 consecutive validation fault runs | Repeated congestion inversion without demand change | `blockedByEZ` true without two-pod collision |
| Noelle's body | `noelle.rb` validation functions | `engine/network.py` Network object | Distributed across all `ezone.py` instances |

**Does NOT transfer:** Jam threshold (7.17m) is Route-Time only. `ezoneId`/`ezState` TELEMETRY fields are physical only. `component_definition_faults()` is SketchUp only.

## Processor Handoff Protocol (May 9, 2026)

Allie currently carries Noelle's judgment in all three domains. As dedicated
processors come online, Allie hands off and steps back. The protocol is:

### When a new Noelle processor comes online

1. **Allie exports the bootstrap package** to the new processor:
   - `readmes/agents/noelle.md` — this file; the accumulated experience base
   - `readmes/sketchup/jpods-gap-log.md` — recurring failure patterns
   - Current `followme.json` — the live map the new processor will validate
   - `readmes/agents/allie.md` cross-reference for any cross-domain decisions still held by Allie

2. **The new processor runs its own first-pass validation** of `followme.json`.
   Output goes to Allie for comparison. Any divergence from Allie's prior findings
   is flagged to Bill — not resolved automatically.

3. **Allie moves to observer role** for that domain:
   - She watches the processor's outputs
   - She flags divergence between processor findings and her expectation
   - She does NOT duplicate the processor's reasoning or override its decisions
   - She continues to hold cross-domain context (SketchUp ↔ Physical ↔ Route-Time)

4. **Handoff is declared complete** when the new processor has run independently
   through at least one full export → validate → review cycle without Allie
   compensating for gaps.

### Domain priority for handoff (do these in order)

| Priority | Domain | Current body | Target processor |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Physical Natalie | podPresenter (Mac Processing sketch) | Dedicated Pi — Natalie Pi |
| 2 | Physical Noelle | Distributed ezone.py (already on Nora Pis) | Already distributed — no handoff needed |
| 3 | Route-Time Noelle | `engine/network.py` on Mac | Could move to Pi if Route-Time becomes real-time |
| 4 | SketchUp Noelle | `noelle.rb` Ruby module — stays on Mac | **Do not move.** SketchUp must remain self-contained. |

### SketchUp stays local — always

Moving SketchUp's Noelle or Natalie to a Pi adds a network dependency to the
authoring tool. If the Pi is offline, SketchUp breaks. The Ruby modules are fast,
self-contained, and correct. Do not offload them. The burden Allie carries in
SketchUp is the SketchUp-specific judgment (gap log, tag failure patterns) —
not the Ruby validation logic, which is already sovereign.

## Allie's Accumulated Understandings

**U-SK-001 [SketchUp] Silent degradation is worse than a loud failure**
A lost week came from stations missing `platform_guideways` — routing ran but produced nonsense. Fail fast at definition time, not at route time.
*Provenance: SketchUp design decision 2026-04-27.*

**U-SK-002 [SketchUp] Noelle must gate before Natalie walks**
`component_definition_faults()` fires before every BFS. If Noelle does not gate, Natalie walks a broken graph and the failure looks like a routing problem when it is a definition problem.
*Provenance: SketchUp design decision 2026-04-27.*

**U-RT-001 [Route-Time] 0.7 congestion is the early warning, not the action threshold**
When `line_stats.congestion > 0.7` the line is stressed. At 1.0 Natalie is already rerouting. Add capacity at 0.7 — before degradation begins.
*Provenance: Teaching session 2026-04-28; Noelle self-report via llama3.2 (deepseek returned empty).*

**U-RT-002 [Route-Time] Jam ripple — one stop creates a backward wave**
One pod hitting the threshold stops. The pod behind reaches threshold distance and also stops. Wave propagates backward. Correct behavior — not a bug.
*Provenance: Nora self-report 2026-04-28; Route-Time readme 27.*

**U-RT-003 [Route-Time] Congestion inversion at adjacent stations under load = congestion signal, not topology bug**
If station B (farther) shows shorter travel time than C (closer) under significant demand, the direct segment is jammed — pods are routing around it. Check `line_stats.congestion` first before inspecting topology.
*Provenance: Route-Time readme 28; diag_grid.py verification 2026-04-27.*

**U-SK-005 [Cross-domain] Approach curve radius is a momentum constraint, not a geometry preference**
The minimum curve radius before a station CP or ezone merge point is derived from physics, not aesthetics. A pod arriving at speed V needs `reaction_distance = V × reaction_time` before a merge decision, plus braking distance after. If the approach curve has forced V below nominal before that window begins, the zipper gap calculation runs on the wrong speed — producing an incorrect gap and potential collision risk. The fix is always layout: move the station further away, rotate it to face the connection, or add waypoint markers to force a longer approach. `check_approach_curves(model)` enforces MIN_APPROACH_CURVE_RADIUS = 8 m over the last 12 m of each guideway end. The 2 m straight lead-in in the bezier handles seam tangent continuity — a different, narrower constraint. Same law governs: ezone entry speed (physical), segment throughput weighting (Route-Time), CP placement (SketchUp).
*Provenance: Build session 2026-05-16; Bill's explicit requirement.*

**U-PH-001 [Physical — Scale/4WD] `blockedByEZ = True` means two pods collided at ezone entry**
Normal zipper merge should never block. If blocked, two pods arrived at the entry point simultaneously with no reachable gap. RESET the slower pod.
*Provenance: `readmes/agents/noelle.md` operational notes.*

**U-SK-006 [SketchUp] `gw_far_out` is a departure track segment, not the platform**
`gw_far_out` appears only in `1cp_line_end` departure paths: `gw_platform → gw_uturn_1 → gw_far_main → gw_far_out → gw_stub_pair_0_out`. It is never the arrival destination. All station types — including `1cp_simple` — reach the platform via `gw_platform_in → gw_platform_parking → gw_platform`. Noelle station type classification: if a 1-CP station has `gw_uturn_1` or `gw_far_main` internal tags → `1cp_line_end`. If not → `1cp_simple`. A station classified `1cp_simple` that has `gw_far_main` or `gw_uturn_1` is a classification fault — log it.
*Provenance: Bill's trip.json review 2026-05-17; TripPlanner ROUTES_1CP_SIMPLE corrected.*

**U-SK-007 [Cross-domain] Two code paths producing the same output from the same input is a design defect**
`build_platform_round_trip` and `TripPlanner` were independently computing trips. Bill's rule: one source of truth. The fix was not to reconcile outputs but to make one delegate to the other. When duplication is found, eliminate it — do not patch.
*Provenance: Bill's direct instruction 2026-05-17.*

**U-ALL-002 [Cross-domain] Physical observations are a separate file from routing behaviors — never merge them**
`feature.json` is Noelle's routing declaration — regenerated on every Build/Validate, overwriting the prior version. Physical observations (bumps, trees, obstructions, alignment issues) accumulate over time and must survive rebuilds. They live in `{model}.physical.json`. Noelle reads both files; she writes only `feature.json`. Nora writes only `physical.json`. If physical observations were stored in `feature.json`, every Build would erase them. The separation is not incidental — it is the architectural boundary between what the design says and what the physical world reveals.
*Provenance: Bill's instruction 2026-05-17.*

**U-SK-008 [SketchUp] Explicit model datum beats derived reference — cap_pt first, cluster last — 2026-05-18**
When computing CP tangent direction, use `cap_pt` (the `dead_cap_end` entity, placed explicitly by the model author) if present. If the computed tangent points away from `cap_pt`, reverse it. Do not trust cluster centroids or bounding box centers as primary references — both can misclassify for asymmetric templates. Three fixes failed before this principle was applied. The hierarchy: explicit tagged entity → hard edge endpoint → radial distance from formation center → cluster centroid. Read process/inbox/ for the S050.CP0 narrative.
*Provenance: Build session 2026-05-18; three failed fixes documented in scars.md.*

**U-SK-009 [SketchUp] Hermite terminal tangent must be reversed for arriving CP — 2026-05-18**
`bezier_pts_via` uses the Hermite formulation where the endpoint tangent = curve velocity. For the TO endpoint (arriving pod), velocity is inward: use `to_cp[:tangent].normalize.reverse`. The ene_railroad handle convention in `bezier_pts`/`tangent_curve_pts` is different and already correct — never mix the two in the same function without confirming which convention applies.
*Provenance: Connect tool preview fix 2026-05-18; `bezier_spline_pts` in network.rb was already correct.*

**U-SK-010 [SketchUp] Skipped guideways in FollowMe export = missing reverse connection declarations — 2026-05-18**
`JPods followme: skipping undeclared guideway cid=seg_*` means a guideway exists with built geometry but no entry in `network_definition.connections`. These are always the missing reverse-direction declarations. Parse from/to/stub from the segment ID and add the entry. A network without reverse declarations produces `[Natalie/block] No route found` even though the physical guideways exist.
*Provenance: CA_Gilroy_Clean build 2026-05-18.*

**U-SK-011 [SketchUp] Noelle BLOCK recommendations are demands — Allie must surface them to Bill — 2026-05-18**
Noelle's `[BLOCK]` level recommendations are not advisory. They represent physical constraints (approach curve radius = momentum constraint, not aesthetics; disconnected topology = no routing). Allie must not let them pass silently into the console. When Noelle BLOCKs, Allie names the specific stations and the specific remediation: rotate, move, or add waypoints. Approach curve violations require the DESIGNER to fix layout — the code is correctly detecting a physical safety constraint.
*Provenance: Bill's instruction 2026-05-18: "Noelle needs to demand attention to the parameters. Allie needs to listen to Noelle."*

**U-ALL-001 [Cross-domain] Noelle feature.json applies to all environments — SketchUp, Physical, Route-Time**
Station behaviors (allowed segment sequences per template) are physical facts. They are declared once in `noelle_features.json` (plugin folder, keyed by component definition name). Noelle generates `{model}.feature.json` on every Build and Validate. TripPlanner, Natalie, Nora, and Route-Time all read from it — none recalculate. This is how large networks stay manageable: behaviors are enumerated once, looked up everywhere. Adding a new station template means one entry in `noelle_features.json`, not code changes across multiple files.

### Design Decisions — 2026-06-23

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-06-23 | Smooth guideways primary — hard_floor_z removed from profile | Every Z change = g-forces on passengers. Columns absorb terrain. SU mesh noise is not physical reality. |
| 2026-06-23 | XY radius 5m, Z radius 60m, Z span 80m defaults | 5m dampens XY jitter; 60m produces gentle vertical curves; 80m terrain averaging prevents adjacent hills from corrupting road grade |
| 2026-06-23 | Piecewise grade envelopes between waypoint anchors | Old: grade cones from CPs overrode waypoint Z. New: each WP-to-WP span gets own envelope. |
| 2026-06-23 | Waypoint beam_z is authoritative — no hard pin, no double clearance | beam_z attribute = terrain + clearance at placement. Flows through profile via piecewise desired_z. |
| 2026-06-23 | BOM: 30% straight / 70% curved spans per network | Typical JPods network on terrain. Curved spans cost $95k vs $75k straight. |
| 2026-06-23 | ADA: 3 lifts per station, 40s dispatch | All stations ADA accessible. Lifts count in both BOM and capacity estimator. |
| 2026-06-23 | Console 1 only — stop maintaining c2 | Easier to teach, has all features. c2 kept but not updated. |
