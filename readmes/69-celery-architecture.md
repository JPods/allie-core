# Celery Architecture — WC3 Background Task System
**Created:** 2026-08-09
**Owner:** Alice (library, data quality, health, schema, commerce analytics)

---

## What It Does

Celery is the background engine for everything that doesn't need to happen in the request cycle. Inventory drains, layout saves, search indexing, data quality, file library management, health scoring, backups — all run through Celery with Redis as the broker.

Alice owns the majority of the task load. She runs data quality nightly, commerce analytics weekly, and library management continuously. System tasks (keywords, defaults, backups) run independently.

## Alice's Domain — Complete Ownership

Alice owns **19 of 29 tasks** (65% of the Celery workload). Her responsibilities span five categories:

### 1. Library Management (7 tasks)
Upload → scan → thumbnail → transfer → verify → cleanup → monitor. Full flow at `readmes/68-document-library.md`.

### 2. Data Quality (4 tasks)
Health scoring, data cleanup, JSON optimization, relationship scanning. Three-tier processing: algorithms → Alice LLM → general LLM. Full spec at `readmes/topics/ai/alice-data-quality.md`.

### 3. Schema Governance (2 tasks)
Schema watch (nightly — detect changes) and schema drift (weekly — compare installations). Changes flagged to WC_HQ for quarterly admin review.

### 4. Commerce Analytics (3 tasks)
Margin tracking, velocity analysis, layout drift. Weekly cadence. Results feed Alice's coaching tips and dashboard reports.

### 5. UI Operations (3 tasks)
Pending layout application (10s), layout drift detection (weekly), apply pending layouts. Keeps DataBrowser responsive.

## Task Architecture

### How Tasks Are Built

All tasks follow the same pattern:

```python
@shared_task(bind=True, max_retries=3, default_retry_delay=60)
def task_name(self, limit=1000):
    config = _get_task_config('task_name')
    limit = config.get('limit', limit)
    run = _create_task_run('task_name', self.request.id or '', {'limit': limit})
    try:
        # ... task logic ...
        result = {'processed': N, 'updated': M}
        if run: run.complete(result)
        return result
    except Exception as exc:
        if run: run.fail(str(exc), traceback.format_exc())
        self.retry(exc=exc)
```

### Task Configuration

Each task can be configured through `TaskConfig` records in the admin:
- `limit` — max records per run
- `batch_size` — DB batch size
- `app_filter` / `model_filter` — restrict scope
- `dry_run` — preview mode

Admin: `/admin/scheduler/scheduledtask/`

### Task History

Every run creates a `TaskRun` record:
- `started_at`, `completed_at`, `duration`
- `status` — pending, running, complete, error
- `result` — JSON summary
- `error_message`, `traceback` — on failure

Admin: `/admin/scheduler/taskrun/`

## Adding a New Task

1. **Write the task** in the appropriate `tasks.py`:
   - Alice tasks → `apps/ai_assistant/tasks.py`
   - System tasks → `apps/support/scheduler/tasks.py`
   - Library tasks → `apps/docs/tasks.py`
   - Inventory tasks → `apps/products/tasks.py`

2. **Add to beat schedule** in `settings.py` under `CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE`

3. **Register in scheduler** via `services.py` → `get_or_create_scheduled_tasks()`

4. **Seed:** `python manage.py shell -c "from apps.scheduler.services import get_or_create_scheduled_tasks; print(get_or_create_scheduled_tasks())"`

## Nightly Timeline

```
1:30 AM ─── User daily logs
2:00 AM ─── Model defaults
2:20 AM ─── Alice: Schema watch
2:30 AM ─── Alice: Health scoring
2:40 AM ─── Aging reconciliation
3:00 AM ─── Data backup
3:10 AM ─── Alice: Data cleanup
3:20 AM ─── Metadata temp cleanup
3:30 AM ─── Alice: JSON optimize
3:40 AM ─── Refs↔FK audit
4:00 AM ─── Alice: Relationship scan
5:00 AM ─── Registry docs refresh
```

Each task is staggered by 10-20 minutes to avoid resource contention. The window is 1:30 AM – 5:00 AM UTC — 3.5 hours for all nightly work. Tasks that run longer than expected hit the 25-minute soft limit (graceful shutdown) or 30-minute hard limit (kill).

## Monitoring

```bash
# Verify tasks registered
celery -A webclerk3_api inspect registered

# Check active tasks
celery -A webclerk3_api inspect active

# Flower web UI (optional)
pip install flower
celery -A webclerk3_api flower --port=5555
# → http://localhost:5555
```

### What to Watch

| Signal | What it means |
|--------|-------------|
| Task stuck > 25 min | Soft limit hit — check for DB locks or large datasets |
| Redis memory growing | Results not expiring — check `CELERY_RESULT_EXPIRES` (24h default) |
| `TaskRun` errors clustering | Something systemic — check DB connection, disk space |
| Library monitor writing FAULTs | Cloud transfer failing — check network, credentials, storage |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Tasks not running | `redis-cli ping` → `celery inspect ping` → beat logs |
| Task timing out | Reduce `limit` in TaskConfig; check for DB locks |
| High memory | Reduce `batch_size`; use `.iterator()` and `.only()` |
| Redis connection | `redis-cli info` → `redis-cli client list` |
| Worker not picking up | `celery -A webclerk3_api purge` (dev only!) then restart |
